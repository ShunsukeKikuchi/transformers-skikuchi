## Overview

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data efficiently. They have revolutionized many NLP tasks, including language modeling, text classification, translation, and more.

This repository aims to provide implementations, examples, and utilities related to transformers for research and production purposes.

## Features

- Modern transformer architectures
- Example scripts for training and evaluation
- Utilities for data preprocessing and tokenization
- Easy-to-follow codebase and documentation

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nodoubtz/transformers.git
cd transformers
```

Install dependencies (replace with your environment manager as needed):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic usage examples will be provided in the `examples/` directory. To train or evaluate a transformer model, run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

For more details, refer to the individual scripts and their documentation.
