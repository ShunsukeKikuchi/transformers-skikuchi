    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`AyaVisionConfig`] or [`AyaVisionVisionConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Args:
        input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide
            it.

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

            [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
        pixel_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, image_size, image_size)):
            The tensors corresponding to the input images. Pixel values can be obtained using
            [`AutoImageProcessor`]. See [`GotOcr2ImageProcessor.__call__`] for details. [`AyaVisionProcessor`] uses
            [`GotOcr2ImageProcessor`] for processing images.
        attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

            If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
            `past_key_values`).

            If you want to change padding behavior, you should read [`modeling_opt._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`]
            and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) for more
            information on the default strategy.

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        position_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0,
            config.n_positions - 1]`. [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
            Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
            blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        vision_feature_layer (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -2):
            The index of the layer to select the vision feature.
        vision_feature_select_strategy (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"default"`):
            The feature selection strategy used to select the vision feature from the vision backbone.
            Can be one of `"default"` or `"full"`. If `"default"`, the CLS token is removed from the vision features.
            If `"full"`, the full vision features are used.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
        cache_position (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
            this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
            the complete sequence length.
