## Overview

Transformers is a library designed to make the latest advances in natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning domains accessible to everyone. It includes pre-trained models, tokenizers, and APIs for seamless integration into your projects.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Use the library with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX according to your preference.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Access a vast collection of pre-trained models for tasks like text classification, translation, question-answering, and more.
- **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Adapt pre-trained models to your specific needs with easy fine-tuning capabilities.
- **Community Contributions**: Leverage and contribute to a vibrant open-source community.

For the original library and more details, visit the [Hugging Face Transformers documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the library, simply run:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

For more installation options and configurations, refer to the [installation guide](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html).

---

### Usage

Below is a simple example to get started with one of the pre-trained models:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer for sentiment analysis
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze sentiment
result = sentiment_analyzer("I love using the Transformers library!")
print(result)
```

For more usage examples and detailed tutorials, check the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers).
