# Transformers

A flexible and modular library for building, training, and deploying transformer-based models.

## Overview

This repository provides components and utilities for working with transformer architectures—state-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more. Use this library to experiment with attention mechanisms, build custom models, or extend existing transformer implementations.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily swap and configure transformer layers, attention mechanisms, and feedforward blocks.
- **Training Utilities:** Tools for dataset preparation, batching, and evaluation.
- **Deployment Scripts:** Export and run models in production environments.
- **Custom Extensions:** Add new transformer blocks or integrate with your ML pipelines.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nodoubtz/transformers.git
cd transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Example: Training a Transformer Model

```python
from transformers import TransformerModel, Trainer

# Initialize your model
model = TransformerModel(config)

# Prepare your data
train_data, val_data = load_data(...)

# Train
trainer = Trainer(model, train_data, val_data, ...)
trainer.train()
```

### Customizing Components

You can easily swap attention mechanisms or feedforward layers by editing the configuration or subclassing the provided modules.
