## Usage

### Example: Training a Transformer Model

```python
from transformers import TransformerModel, Trainer

# Initialize your model
model = TransformerModel(config)

# Prepare your data
train_data, val_data = load_data(...)

# Train
trainer = Trainer(model, train_data, val_data, ...)
trainer.train()
```

### Customizing Components

You can easily swap attention mechanisms or feedforward layers by editing the configuration or subclassing the provided modules.
