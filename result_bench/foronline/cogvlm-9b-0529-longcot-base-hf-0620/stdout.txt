The material has failed due to reaching its maximum shear stress, indicated by the necking near the center.\n(B). The clamps on both sides rotate in the same direction, ensuring uniform shear distribution.\n(C). The specimen is tested in a pure tension setup rather than torsion, as evidenced by elongation at the center.\n(D). The deformation pattern suggests the material is undergoing ductile failure.\n(E). The video shows a brittle fracture, as evidenced by the sharp edges forming at the center of the specimen.'}]}]
