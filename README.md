# Transformers

ðŸ¤— Transformers: State-of-the-art Machine Learning for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

## Overview

This repository is a fork of the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, which provides state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and models. It supports multiple frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

Visit the official [Transformers documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers) for detailed guides and examples.

## Installation

To install the library, use:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

For more installation options, refer to the [installation guide](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html).

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of using the library:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Create a sentiment-analysis pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

result = classifier("I love using Transformers!")
print(result)
```

For more examples, check out the [usage documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/usage.html).
