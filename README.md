Welcome to the **Transformers** repository! This project is a fork of the [Hugging Face Transformers repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and provides state-of-the-art Machine Learning implementations for **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **JAX**.

---

## Overview

Transformers is a library designed to make cutting-edge advances in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and other **Machine Learning** domains accessible to everyone. It includes:
- A vast collection of pre-trained models.
- Support for multiple frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.
- Easy fine-tuning capabilities for custom use cases.

Visit the [Hugging Face Transformers Documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers) for in-depth details.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Framework Support**: Use PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX seamlessly.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Access a wide range of models for tasks like text classification, translation, and question-answering.
- **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Easily adapt pre-trained models to your specific needs.
- **Vibrant Community**: Leverage and contribute to an active open-source community.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the library, run:
```bash
pip install transformers
```

For additional installation options, refer to the [installation guide](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html).

---

### Quick Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get started with a pre-trained model for **sentiment analysis**:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer for sentiment analysis
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze sentiment
result = sentiment_analyzer("I love using the Transformers library!")
print(result)
```

For more examples and tutorials, check the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers).
