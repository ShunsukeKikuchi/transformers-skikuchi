- 🔒 Focus on secure model management and vulnerability mitigation.
- 🛠️ Compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.
- 🚀 Based on the Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem, with improvements and extensions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nodoubtz/2lit-formers.git
```

### Usage

Import and use pre-trained models as you would with Hugging Face Transformers:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
```
