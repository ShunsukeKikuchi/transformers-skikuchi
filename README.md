Transformers is a powerful library designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides pre-trained models and tools to fine-tune and deploy state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures.

## Features
=======
```py
# venv
python -m venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
# uv
uv venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
```
main

- **Pre-trained Models:** Access a wide range of pre-trained transformer models.
- **Custom Fine-tuning:** Easily fine-tune models for your own datasets and use cases.
- **Easy Inference:** Perform NLP tasks such as text classification, translation, summarization, and more.
- **Extensibility:** Build custom transformer architectures and workflows.

main
## Installation

To install the library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers
=======
```py
# pip
pip install "transformers[torch]"

# uv
uv pip install "transformers[torch]"
main
```

## Getting Started

main
Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with Transformers:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a sentiment analysis pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Perform inference
result = classifier("I love using Transformers!")
print(result)
=======
```shell
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers

# pip
pip install .[torch]

# uv
uv pip install .[torch]
main
```

## Overview

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data efficiently. They have revolutionized many NLP tasks, including language modeling, text classification, translation, and more.

This repository aims to provide implementations, examples, and utilities related to transformers for research and production purposes.

## Features

- Modern transformer architectures
- Example scripts for training and evaluation
- Utilities for data preprocessing and tokenization
- Easy-to-follow codebase and documentation

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nodoubtz/transformers.git
cd transformers
```

Install dependencies (replace with your environment manager as needed):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic usage examples will be provided in the `examples/` directory. To train or evaluate a transformer model, run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

For more details, refer to the individual scripts and their documentation.
